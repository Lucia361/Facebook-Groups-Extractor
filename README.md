### Why I Used Javascript? :
- Everyone can use It without Installing Python or any other external Library or Software.
- No need to Emulate Chrome or using any Webdriver such as Selenium.
- Very Fast and Works using On-Page Query to Reduce the Chance of Facebook Jail.
- Multi-OS Working Pattern.
- Easy to Use for Non-Technical People as well.

### Why I Hard-Coded and Obfuscated the Code? :
If I directly run the code, It may trigger various events which is easy to trace by the Facebook AI. It sounds Ridiculous but Using Vanilla Code has a high risk of Facebook Jail.
